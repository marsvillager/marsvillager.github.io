features:
  - title: CVE
    details: 1. Utilizing embedding techniques to compute vectors for each tactic/technique in the Mitre ATT&CK matrix. For each CVE entry, peforming vectorization and calculating cosine similarity with the vectors of each tactic/technique to identify the top similar tactics.<br> 2. Leveraging the analytical capabilities of Large Language Model (LLM) to conduct semantic and contextual analysis of host information and CVE configurations. This facilitates the identification of potential vulnerabilities and security risks through comprehensive analysis and correlation. 
  - title: Zero-Knowledge Proof
    details: "Developing an encrypted traffic management policy based on zero-knowledge proofs:<br>-The client sends a zero-knowledge proof to the middle box, proving that the traffic of the encrypted channel complies with the policy.<br>-The middle box verifies the proof sent by the client and decides whether to forward the encrypted traffic to the server based on the verification result."
  - title: Visualization
    details: Visualize data using tools such as Observable Plot, d3.js, and neo4j.
