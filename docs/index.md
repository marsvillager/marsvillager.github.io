features:
  - title: Security
    details: Build a security knowledge base that breaks the three-layer defense, with the first layer being the attack chain/matrix, the second layer being vulnerabilities, and the third layer being a summarized log graph.
  - title: NLP
    details: Using the Large Language Model (LLVM) as an Intermediate Representation (IR) to achieve abstract transformation of arbitrary input types, compatibility and inclusiveness, in order to achieve input independence.
  - title: Graph
    details: Compared to traditional feature engineering, the features learned by Prompt Learning are very coarse-grained and lack detailed interpretation and parsing of the original text. However, they have stronger generalization ability and robustness, and often achieve better results than traditional models in processing language data. Therefore, I believe that graphs with complex features and huge amounts of information, like languages, will also make breakthrough progress in attack detection in this field.
